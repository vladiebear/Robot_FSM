Extension of the Elma Robot in a simulated environment. This will be an extension of the robot finite state machine
simulated in a 2D environment. The robot will be able to navigate the 2D space for as long as the battery is charged.
There will be an intruder in the 2D space and the robot will avoid the intruder. if the robot runs out of battery 
the robot will go back to the charging station and recharge for a set amount of time. This will reset the state 
machine and will be allowed to continue once the user presses a button. 

Milestones:
1.  Write tests
2.  Set up data streaming and visualization tools
3.  Code the finite state machine and test with data streaming
4.  Port data to 2D environment 
5.  Final tests and documentation
