ECE590_FinalProject

This final project will be an extension of the Elma Robot in a simulated environment. This will be an extension of the robot finite state machine simulated in a 2D environment. The robot will be able to navigate the 2D space for trash.
The user can add trash points and they will randomly appear in the grid with every push of the key 't' as instructed. 
there is a timer that times your trash collecting skills, so dont hesitate! collect that trash as fast as you can.
the states are defined as:

on -> clean <-> stop -> off -> on

The robot will pick up the trash once it hovers over the trash. The user can move the robot with the arrow keys.

Success will be had if the robot can collect all the trash! 

Milestones:
1.  Write tests (March 20)
2.  Set up data streaming and visualization tools (March 21)
3.  Code the finite state machine and test with data streaming (March 22)
4.  Port data to 2D environment (March 23)
5.  Final tests and documentation (March 23)
6.  Add random wander and autonomous trash collection (??)
7.  Add time the random walk of the robot (??)
