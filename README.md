ECE590_FinalProject

This final project will be an extension of the Elma Robot in a simulated environment. This will be an extension of the robot finite state machine simulated in a 2D environment. The robot will be able to navigate the 2D space for as long as the battery is charged.
There will be an intruder in the 2D space and the robot will avoid the intruder. if the robot runs out of battery 
the robot will go back to the charging station and recharge for a set amount of time. This will reset the state 
machine and will be allowed to continue once the user presses a button. 

The robot will be able to interact with different objects around the world. It will be able to wander on its own and
explore while displaying information about the objects it tries to interact with, and the ability to interact with
the object with user preference (i.e. move the object, destroy it etc).

Success will be had if the robot can wander around and move objects around the space. 

Milestones:
1.  Write tests (March 20)
2.  Set up data streaming and visualization tools (March 21)
3.  Code the finite state machine and test with data streaming (March 22)
4.  Port data to 2D environment (March 23)
5.  Final tests and documentation (March 23)
6.  Add intruder to wander (??)
7.  Add function for robot to stay away from intruder (??)
